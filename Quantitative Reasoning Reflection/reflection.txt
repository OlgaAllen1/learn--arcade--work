1.) Describe how you used multiple quantitative methods, techniques and
    algorithms to add functionality to your program. How did you decide what
    method to use? For example, how did you use lists? “If” statements? Loops?
    Classes? Functions? Sample pieces of code? How did you decide which methods
    to apply? Feel free to give examples.


2.) Explain how you communicate your solution (from one programmer to another)
    when writing the code. Show how variable names matter, how function names
    matter, how comments and structure make your code easier to read.


3.) How did you test and evaluate the accuracy of your code? When something
    didn’t work, describe how you debugged what the error was. Also, how do you
    determine if data returned is correct data?


4.) What are the limitations to using numerical methods to make decisions?
    For example, why can’t we just replace humans with algorithms? Why can’t we
    just evaluate students based solely on test scores? Why can’t we evaluate
    teachers just on how their students do? What is the limitation to evaluating
    athletes just on their stats?
