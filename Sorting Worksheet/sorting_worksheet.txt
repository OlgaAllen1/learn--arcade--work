1. Write code to swap the values 25 and 40.

my_list = [55, 41, 52, 68, 45, 27, 40, 25, 37, 26]

2. Write code to swap the values 2 and 27.

my_list = [27, 32, 18,  2, 11, 57, 14, 38, 19, 91]

3. Why does the following code not work? Explain it, don't just list working code.

my_list = [70, 32, 98, 88, 92, 36, 81, 83, 87, 66]
temp = my_list[0]
my_list[1] = my_list[0]
my_list[0] = temp

4. Show how the following numbers can be sorted using the selection sort. Show
the numbers after each iteration of the outer loop, similar to what is shown in
the book. I am NOT looking for a copy of the code to do the sort. If you include
any code for problems 4-7 you are doing it wrong.

97   74    8   22   47   92   18   11    0   60

5. Show how the following numbers can be sorted using the selection sort:

73   92   28   47   30   58    0   36   31   25

6. Show how the following numbers can be sorted using the INSERTION sort.
(Note: If you think the 0 gets immediately sorted into position, you are doing
it wrong. Go back and re-read how this sort works.)

97   74    8   22   47   92   18   11    0   60

7. Show how the following numbers can be sorted using the insertion sort:

73   92   28   47   30   58    0   36   31   25

8. Explain what `min_pos` does in the selection sort.

9. Explain what `cur_pos` does in the selection sort.

10. Explain what `scan_pos` does in the selection sort.

11. Explain what `key_pos` and `key_value` are in the insertion sort.

12. Explain `scan_pos` in the insertion sort.

13. Look at the example sort program at the very end of this chapter:

https://learn.arcade.academy/en/latest/chapters/30_sorting/sorting.html

Modify the sorts to print the number of times the inside loop is run, and the
number of times the outside loop is run. Modify the program to work with a list
of 100. Paste the code you used here. Run the program and list the numbers you
got here. (DON'T FORGET TO INCLUDE THE RESULTS!) Inside loop for selection sort
should be about 5,000, and insertion sort 2,500. Double-check if you don't get
numbers close to these.
